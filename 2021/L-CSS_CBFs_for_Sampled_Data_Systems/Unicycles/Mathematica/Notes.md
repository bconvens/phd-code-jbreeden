# Notes

Earlier versions of the CBF implemented in this folder included an additional parameter $$\psi$$ (see [Calculations.nb](Calculations.nb)). Though this parameter is no longer used, we've opted to keep this parameter in the current code. To reproduce our results, simply let $$\psi=0$$, though future researchers may also be interested in the effect of modifying $$\psi$$.
