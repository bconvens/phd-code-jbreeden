## Safety-Critical Control for Systems with Impulsive Actuators and Dwell Time Constraints

This folder contains code for a paper on impulsive control barrier functions. The above folders contain an example on both a [linear](Linear) system and a [nonlinear](Nonlinear) system. Both systems are representative of satellite relative motion control. Details on the [linear](Linear) system can be found in the [first version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10243v1) of the paper preprint, while details on the [nonlinear](Nonlinear) system can be found in the second version of the paper. Note that the nonlinear system is substantially less conservative than its linearization, so the dwell times considered are larger. The [nonlinear](Nonlinear) system is also the most recent version of the code, so there may be bug fixes in that folder that are not yet realized in the [linear](Linear) system code.
